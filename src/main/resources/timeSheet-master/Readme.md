# TimeSheet Calculator
This is a **simple timesheet calculator** written in javascript. It uses [Twitter Bootstrap](twitter.github.io/bootstrap/) for tables and styling, and uses [ChartKick.js](https://github.com/ankane/chartkick.js) to graph what you spend your time on into a pie graph.

The javascript is written using [Prototype.js](prototypejs.org).

All functionality for this app is enclosed in one class, named timeKeep, in **js/timekeep-proto.js**.
